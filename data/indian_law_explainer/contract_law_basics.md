# Indian Contract Law – Basic Principles (Simplified)

Under Indian law, a contract is an agreement enforceable by law. 
For a valid contract, certain basic elements are usually present.

These include:
- Offer and acceptance
- Intention to create legal relations
- Lawful consideration
- Capacity of parties
- Free consent
- Lawful object

Contracts can be written or oral, unless a specific law requires them to be in writing.
